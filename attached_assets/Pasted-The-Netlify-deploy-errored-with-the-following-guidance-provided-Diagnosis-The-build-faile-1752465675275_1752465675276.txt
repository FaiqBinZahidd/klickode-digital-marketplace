The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with the following error:
- Line 70: `Failed during stage 'building site': Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2`
- Line 74: `[vite:esbuild] Transform failed with 1 error:`
- Line 75: `/opt/build/repo/client/src/components/simple-stars.tsx:82:3: ERROR: Expected ";" but found "python"`

**Solution:**
1. The error is in the file `client/src/components/simple-stars.tsx` at line 82. There seems to be a syntax error or unexpected token `'python'`.
   
2. To fix this issue:
   - Go to the file `client/src/components/simple-stars.tsx` in your repository.
   - Check line 82 for any syntax errors or unexpected tokens. Ensure that the code is correct and there are no misplaced characters.
   - Correct the code by adding the expected `;` or fixing the `'python'` token appropriately.
   - After correcting the file, commit the changes to your repository.

This should resolve the build failure caused by the syntax error in the specified file.
