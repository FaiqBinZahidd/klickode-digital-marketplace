The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build is failing with the following error:
```
[vite:esbuild] Transform failed with 1 error:
/client/src/components/space-stars.tsx:16:33: ERROR: Unexpected end of file
```
This error is caused by an unexpected end of file in the `/client/src/components/space-stars.tsx` file.

### Solution
1. Open the `space-stars.tsx` file and ensure that the file is complete with no missing or incomplete code at the end of the file.
2. Verify that the `useEffect` hook and its contents are correctly defined in the file to avoid encountering this error.
3. If the file seems correct, run a linter to ensure there are no syntax errors that might be causing this issue.
4. If the issue persists, run `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` as suggested in the warning about outdated browsers data on line 76.
5. If needed, update the code in the `space-stars.tsx` file to resolve the unexpected end of file error.

Make sure the file was committed to the repository and is structured correctly before proceeding with the mentioned solution steps.
