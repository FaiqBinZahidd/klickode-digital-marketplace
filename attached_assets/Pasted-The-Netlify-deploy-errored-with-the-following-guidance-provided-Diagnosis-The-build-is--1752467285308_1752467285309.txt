The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis:

The build is failing at line 82 in the `klickode-logo.tsx` file because there are multiple exports with the same name "default."

### Solution:

To fix this issue:
1. In the `klickode-logo.tsx` file, remove or rename one of the `export default KlickodeLogo;` declarations to have unique names.
2. After making this change, push the updated code to the repository.
3. Verify that the package is in the `package.json` and was committed to the repository.

Once these steps are completed, trigger a new build to verify that the issue has been resolved.
